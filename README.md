> **Prove your credentials without revealing your identity. Participate safely in verified communities.**

AnonShare enables anonymous participation in verified communities through advanced zero-knowledge cryptography. Users can prove their organizational affiliation (university, company, government) without exposing personal information, creating safe spaces for sensitive discussions.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**The Doxxing Dilemma**: Online communities need verification for credibility, but traditional verification exposes users to:
- Identity theft and doxxing
- Professional retaliation  
- Personal safety risks
- Harassment and stalking

**Current Solutions Fall Short**:
- Anonymous platforms lack credibility
- Verified platforms expose identity
- Pseudonymous systems are easily compromised

## 🚀 Innovation

AnonShare introduces **Selective Disclosure Verification** - a breakthrough application of zero-knowledge proofs that enables:

### 🔒 **Cryptographic Privacy**
- **SHA-256 commitments** hide personal data
- **Groth16-style ZK proofs** verify credentials without exposure
- **Rate-limiting nullifiers** prevent spam while preserving anonymity

### 🏆 **Anonymous Reputation**
- Build trust without revealing identity
- Consistent scoring across sessions
- Sybil-resistant through cryptographic nullifiers

### 🌐 **Universal Verification**
- Government IDs (Aadhaar, Passport, Driver's License)
- Academic credentials (University IDs, Transcripts)
- Corporate identification (Employee badges)

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description | Innovation Level |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Zero-Knowledge Verification** | Prove credentials without revealing identity | 🔥 Breakthrough |
| **Rate-Limiting Nullifiers** | Prevent spam while maintaining anonymity | 🔥 Advanced |
| **Anonymous Reputation** | Build trust without identity linkage | 🔥 Novel |
| **Selective Disclosure** | Show organization, hide personal details | 🔥 Innovative |
| **Real Document Support** | Works with actual government/academic IDs | ⭐ Practical |
| **Cryptographic Visualizations** | Educational animations of ZK processes | ⭐ Professional |

```

### Core Components

#### 1. **Identity Verification Pipeline**
```javascript
// Private inputs (hidden)
const privateInputs = {
    nameHash: SHA256(name + salt),
    idHash: SHA256(idNumber + salt),
    secretNonce: randomBytes(32)
};

// Public outputs (visible)
const publicOutputs = {
    organizationType: getOrgType(organization), // 1=Academic, 2=Corporate, 3=Government
    roleType: getRoleType(role),               // 1=Student, 2=Employee, 3=Faculty
    verificationScore: calculateScore(document)
};
```

#### 2. **Rate-Limiting Nullifiers**
```javascript
// Prevent spam without revealing identity
const epoch = Math.floor(Date.now() / (1000 * 60 * 60)); // 1-hour epochs
const nullifier = SHA256(userSecret + epoch + nonce);     // Unique per post
// Allows 5 posts per hour per user
```

#### 3. **Anonymous Reputation System**
```javascript
// Build reputation without identity exposure
const anonymousId = SHA256(userSecret + "reputation_id");
const reputation = {
    postCount: userPosts.length,
    avgScore: calculateAverageScore(userPosts),
    engagementRate: calculateEngagement(userPosts),
    consistencyScore: calculateConsistency(userPosts)
};
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with WebCrypto API support
- Internet connection for AI-powered document analysis

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anonshare.git
cd anonshare
```

2. **Start local server**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Or use any static file server
```

3. **Open in browser**
```bash
open http://localhost:8000
```

### Configuration

1. **Set up AI services** (optional - demo works without)
```javascript
// config.js
const CONFIG = {
    GROQ_API_KEY: 'your-groq-api-key',
    MIDNIGHT_NETWORK_URL: 'https://midnight-testnet.io'
};
```

2. **Deploy to production**
```bash
# Using Vercel
vercel --prod

# Using Netlify
netlify deploy --prod
```

## 📱 Usage

### For Users

1. **Upload Identity Document**
   - Government ID (Aadhaar, Passport, Driver's License)
   - Academic credential (University ID, Transcript)
   - Corporate identification (Employee badge)

2. **Generate Zero-Knowledge Proof**
   - Personal data is hashed and hidden
   - Organization/role is cryptographically verified
   - Proof is submitted to Midnight Network

3. **Participate Anonymously**
   - Post in verified communities
   - Build anonymous reputation
   - Engage safely in sensitive discussions

### For Developers

```javascript
// Initialize AnonShare
const anonshare = new AnonShare({
    network: 'midnight-testnet',
    rateLimit: 5, // posts per hour
    minVerificationScore: 4
});

// Verify document
const proof = await anonshare.verifyDocument(documentFile);

// Submit anonymous post
const result = await anonshare.submitPost(content, proof);
```
